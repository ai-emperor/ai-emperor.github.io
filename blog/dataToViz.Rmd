I’m delighted to announce a new dataviz project called ‘[Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com)’.

#What it is

[From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) is a classification of chart types based on input data format. It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent the dataset.
 
The decision trees are available in a [poster](https://www.data-to-viz.com/poster.html) that has been presented at the [UseR conference](https://user2018.r-project.org/) in Brisbane.
